Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to launch Linux EC2 instances across two different AWS regions (N. Virginia and Ohio) using a single Terraform configuration file. It satisfies the requirements for using Terraform, AWS CLI, and AWS EC2 instances.

Tech Stack
AWS EC2: Scalable virtual computing environments.

Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to automate the deployment.

AWS CLI: Command-line interface used for authentication and identity verification.

What I Completed
Infrastructure as Code: Created a main.tf file defining providers for us-east-1 and us-east-2.

Resource Provisioning: Successfully initialized and applied the Terraform configuration.

Identity Verification: Verified AWS account connectivity using identity tools.

Files in this Repository
main.tf: The primary Terraform configuration file.
